      Welcome to the help page for <span class="join">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban project management
      tool. Here, we'll provide an
      overview of what
      <span class="join">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="join">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of
      dedicated students as part of
      their web
      development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
      work-in-progress, and maximize
      efficiency (or flow). <span class="join">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their
      tasks and projects in an
      intuitive, visual
      interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that <span class="join">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not
      intended for extensive
      business usage. While we
      strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability,
      accuracy, or other aspects
      of quality regarding <span class="join">Join</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="join">Join</span>:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Exploring the Board</strong>
        <p>When you log in to <span class="join">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your
          project and contains four
          default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", "await feedback" and "Done".</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Creating Contacts</strong>
        <p>In <span class="join">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
          section, click on "New
          contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
          interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adding Cards</strong>
        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the
          "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task
          name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Moving Cards</strong>
        <p>You can move cards between lists by dragging and dropping them. This helps you to track the progress of your
          tasks and to see what's in progress and what's done.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Editing and Deleting</strong>
        <p>You can edit or delete a card by clicking on it. This will open up a detailed view of the card, where you can
          make changes to the card's details, or delete it completely. Similarly, you can also edit or delete contacts
          by clicking on them in the "Contacts" section.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
